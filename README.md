# DeaDBeeF Text File for OBS
Writes a customizable string to a file, probably with the current song name so you can use it in an OBS text source. 

I don't actually know how to install a plugin if you aren't using a portable version of DeaDBeeF. But if you are, just put the plugin file in the plugins folder and restart the game. 

Edit plugin settings by going to Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins -> OBS Text File.

You can format the text however you want, but I would not recommend adding any sort of playback time, as it only updates when the song starts or stops. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZnA0sPekUrvo1zb5vNfaUfWwRP6IfzHMpRQw5Yzl904) are the current options for title formatting. 

Default path is probably in the DeaDBeeF folder.
